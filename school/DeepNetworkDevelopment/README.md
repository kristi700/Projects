## DeepNetworkDevelopment

Most likely, only the second assignment will be developed here, because the first one didn't interest me enough to put effort in (basic object detection with CNN backbone and 2 linear heads, then comparing it with yolo11). But I might will upload it, either way, thats not something to judge:))
