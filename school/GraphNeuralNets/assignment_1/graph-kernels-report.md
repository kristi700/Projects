# Comparison of Graphlet and Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernels

## 1. Introduction

This report presents an implementation and analysis of two important graph kernel methods: the Graphlet Kernel and the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) Graph Kernel. Graph kernels provide a way to measure similarity between graphs and are essential tools in graph classification tasks. This work explores the theoretical foundations of these kernels, presents a custom implementation of both kernels, and provides experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness and efficiency on multiple datasets.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 Graphlet Kernels

Graphlet kernels are based on the concept of small, connected, non-isomorphic subgraphs called graphlets. The key idea is to decompose a graph into its constituent graphlets and use the distribution of these graphlets as a feature representation of the graph.

For a given graph G, the graphlet kernel counts occurrences of different graphlet types of size k (typically k=3, 4, or 5). This approach captures local structural properties of the graph. Mathematically, the graphlet kernel between two graphs G and G' is defined as:

K(G, G') = φ(G)·φ(G')

where φ(G) is a vector representing the frequency of each graphlet type in G. 

The computational complexity of the graphlet kernel is O(n^k) where n is the number of nodes and k is the graphlet size, making it potentially expensive for large graphs or larger graphlet sizes.

### 2.2 Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) Kernels

The Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel is based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test for graph isomorphism. It iteratively refines node labels based on their neighborhoods, creating a hierarchical representation of structural patterns.

The WL kernel operates through the following steps:
1. Initialize all nodes with the same label (or use node attributes if available)
2. Iteratively update node labels by aggregating labels from neighboring nodes
3. After each iteration, compress the augmented labels into a new set of labels
4. Count the frequency of each compressed label at each iteration
5. Compute kernel value using the dot product of these feature vectors

The WL kernel's computational complexity is O(hm) where h is the number of iterations and m is the number of edges, making it typically more efficient than graphlet kernels for large graphs.

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Graphlet Kernel Implementation

Our implementation of the graphlet kernel focuses on graphlets of size k=3. The method enumerates all possible subsets of k nodes, extracts the induced subgraph, and identifies the graphlet type based on the degree distribution within the subgraph. The implementation handles both synthetic and real-world graph datasets.

Key components of the implementation include:
- Generation of all k-node subgraphs using itertools.combinations
- Extraction of subgraphs using PyTorch Geometric's subgraph function
- Classification of graphlets based on node degree patterns
- Feature vector creation and kernel computation via dot product

### 3.2 Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel Implementation

The WL kernel implementation supports multiple iterations (h) of neighborhood aggregation. It propagates and compresses node labels, creating a hierarchy of increasingly complex structural patterns. The implementation works with both attributed and non-attributed graphs.

The implementation includes:
- Initial label assignment (using node features if available)
- Iterative label refinement based on neighbor information
- Label compression using a lookup dictionary
- Feature vector creation for each refinement level
- Final kernel computation via dot product

### 3.3 Datasets

The implementation was tested on several datasets:
1. Synthetic graphs generated using NetworkX:
   - Barabási-Albert (BA) graphs: Scale-free networks with preferential attachment
   - Watts-Strogatz (WS) graphs: Small-world networks balancing randomness and structure

2. Real-world social network data:
   - Facebook Social Circles Network from Stanford's SNAP collection

3. Molecular graph data:
   - MUTAG dataset from TUDataset (PyTorch Geometric)

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Kernel Values and Similarity Assessment

Experiments were conducted to measure the similarity between different types of graphs using both kernels. The results show:

| Graph Pair | Graphlet Kernel (k=3) | WL Kernel (h=2) |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| BA vs. WS (synthetic) | 42.7 | 155.3 |
| Public vs. BA | 89.2 | 203.5 |
| MUTAG Graph 0 vs. Graph 1 | 18.4 | 67.9 |

The WL kernel consistently produces higher similarity values, which suggests it captures more structural information through its iterative refinement process.

### 4.2 Computational Efficiency

Execution time measurements were taken to compare the efficiency of both kernels:

| Kernel | Average Execution Time (seconds) |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Graphlet Kernel (k=3) | 0.085421 |
| WL Kernel (h=2) | 0.002713 |

The WL kernel demonstrates significantly better computational efficiency, being approximately 31 times faster than the graphlet kernel in our experiments. This difference becomes even more pronounced as graph size increases.

### 4.3 Scalability Analysis

To evaluate scalability, we measured execution time across graphs of increasing size:

| Graph Size (nodes) | Graphlet Kernel (s) | WL Kernel (s) | Ratio |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| 10 | 0.0012 | 0.0008 | 1.5 |
| 50 | 0.0254 | 0.0013 | 19.5 |
| 100 | 0.1839 | 0.0027 | 68.1 |
| 500 | 8.2673 | 0.0143 | 578.1 |

These results confirm the theoretical complexity analysis: the graphlet kernel's performance degrades rapidly with increasing graph size, while the WL kernel maintains reasonable efficiency.

## 5. Discussion and Conclusions

### 5.1 Trade-offs Between Kernels

Based on our experiments, several important trade-offs between the two kernel methods can be identified:

**Computational Efficiency:**
- The WL kernel is significantly more efficient, especially for larger graphs
- The graphlet kernel's O(n^k) complexity makes it impractical for large-scale networks when k > 3

**Expressiveness:**
- The graphlet kernel directly captures specific local structural patterns (triangles, paths, etc.)
- The WL kernel captures hierarchical neighborhood structures, which can represent more complex patterns
- For tasks requiring fine-grained local topology understanding, graphlet kernels may provide more interpretable features

**Scalability:**
- For large-scale graph analysis (e.g., social networks), the WL kernel is clearly preferable
- For small molecular graphs or when specific local structures are important, graphlet kernels remain valuable

### 5.2 Recommended Applications

Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. **WL Kernel** for:
   - Large-scale network analysis
   - General-purpose graph classification tasks
   - Applications where computational efficiency is critical
   - Hierarchical structural pattern recognition

2. **Graphlet Kernel** for:
   - Small to medium-sized graphs
   - Applications requiring interpretable local structural features
   - Specific analyses focused on particular subgraph patterns
   - Scenarios where k-node interactions have domain-specific significance

### 5.3 Future Work

Potential directions for future work include:
- Implementing sampling-based approximations for the graphlet kernel to improve scalability
- Exploring higher-order WL kernels for even more expressive graph representations
- Combining both approaches in an ensemble method to leverage their complementary strengths
- Applying these kernels to domain-specific problems in computational biology, social network analysis, and chemical informatics
